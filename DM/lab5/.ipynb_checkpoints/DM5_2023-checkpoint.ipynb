    "In this lab, we will focus on web scraping, which involves programmatically interacting with websites to parse and extract relevant data. This process can range from a simple extraction of specific elements, like headlines or prices, to more complex tasks, such as navigating through multiple pages or handling dynamically loaded content.\n",

    "1.   Data gathering: Amassing large datasets from multiple sources to serve as input for Machine Learning or data analysis.\n",
    "2.   Market research: Extracting product information, reviews, and pricing to identify trends or perform competitive analysis.\n",
    "3.   Opinion Mining in Social Media: Collecting user-generated content, like social media posts or reviews, to analyze public opinion on a particular topic or product.\n",

Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.”\n",

It helps to automatically organize, understand, and summarize large collections of textual data. Topic modeling has numerous applications, such as:\n",
    "\n",

    "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular generative probabilistic model used for topic modeling. LDA assumes that each document is a mixture of topics, and each topic is a distribution over words. The primary goal of LDA is to learn the topic distributions for each document and the word distributions for each topic."

    "### Stemming & Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA performs best when working with clean data. Here we introduce two simple steps we can perform in text data cleaning / preprocessing. These two steps we introduce are not always necessary, but they help some algorithms perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming and lemmatization are natural language processing techniques used to reduce words to their base or root form. These techniques are commonly used in text preprocessing to reduce the dimensionality of the data, decrease noise, and improve the performance of text analysis algorithms. The main difference between the two is the approach they take to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Stemming algorithms work by cutting off the end or beginning of a \n",
    "    word, considering only a few common prefixes and suffixes. This can lead to crude results where the stemmed word might not always be a valid word in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lemmatization**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Lemmatization algorithms take a more structured approach, considering the morphological analysis of the words. They aim to return the base or dictionary form of a word, known as the lemma. Lemmatization generally provides better results as it takes into account the context and part of speech of the word.\n",

       "' She was interviewed and talked about how Bitcoin was bad because it was backed by “nothing,” and how CBDC’s would be great because it’s identical technology but backed by the government. \\n\\nIt was an accidental ad for Bitcoin The government is like the Arbitrum DAO, the illusion that your vote matters and youll be represented. In the end theyll push what they want regardless of how their constituents feel about it Wouldn\\'t a CBDC remove the need for banks in many situations? We are lead by liars and crooks. dystopian horror Please dont offer to sell your crypto to fund her similarly corrupt rival either 🤣 Remember when Elizabeth Warren pretended to be a Native American for decades?  She’s a particularly weird fraud.\\n\\nWhether she gets re-elected or not, cryptocurrencies will be unstoppable, which is all that drives cryptocurrencies to grow. The weekend is over. and the cbdc is backed up by faith in the government and its printing press. Once upon a time some colonies came together to free themselves from the tyranny of royal rule; it appears it has slowly, over time, reformed itself at our expense... It\\'s not that they don\\'t want crypto, it\\'s that they want to control crypto for their selves. As a high level crypto/blockchain developer, I can confidently tell you that CBDCs are the most dangerous thing to society next to nuclear war.\\n\\nThe fortunate thing, most developers don’t want anything to do with them. It could still realistically happen. It allows the government to swap printing for pressing return, and it’s a SCARY tool to monitor society. Privacy disappears immediately.\\n\\nI’ve consulted for several NGOs, Top 10 Banks, two governments, and 3 of 5 FAANG companies on blockchain development. All have their sights on this pie, and WAY more than AI.\\n\\nPlease. Please pay attention to this as it develops. Vote against it. Campaign and donate against it. Do all you can. Saylor 2024 Banks failing, inflation hitting hard, US bonds suffering meltdowns.\\nBut wait, let\\'s forget all that and do some stupid shit just because we hate Crypto. Anything she is a fan of, I am not. Big government politicians doing big government policy you don’t say. Stop voting for these skells. Ban her. Not a surprise. She wants to centralize everything into the governments hands. Tell me you\\'re a government shill without saying you\\'re a shill You seppos have some of the dumbest politicians in the world, and I’m australian …. We might have the dumbest ever but you lot are really starting to take the cake … She\\'d shill you LUNA if it was released by the government... Because she is pro banks and crypto threatens them! Isn\\'t this obvious by now? The senator who runs oversight on the too-big-to-fail banks wants to give them even more power through CBDCs. The government does not want financial freedom for the people or any sort of decentralized monetary system.  If they cannot control at will every aspect of it then they will fight and take it to extreme measures.  \\n\\nFuck CBDCs and Fuck Warren.  The government has proven to be irresponsible at managing money, so giving them full control over CBDCs would be even worse.  They are definitely NOT safe when the government can mint as much as they want, when they want.  The value will crash in a matter of years if not months Liz Warren is the worst Ahh yes, exactly what I need in my life: currency that can be monitored and is also mutable. Hot take: I\\'m not against CBDC. They provide far more flexibility on those who need/want to keep using fiat while introducing people to this new internet money thing. I think that CBDCs will be an entry point for those who, after introduced to this new and exciting tech that is blockchain, migrate to decentralised options.\\n\\nAlso, I don\\'t really much mind it - with all the shitfest that most stables have been, I think this could be a good option for tradfi or for keeping your investments safe from volatility in between trading sessions. It\\'s not like you can \\\\*actually\\\\* trust stablecoins these days to do that (lost money with USTC, bad day to have dumped profits into it, it was just for a few days). To think I used to kinda like her. But she\\'s turned out to be such a fucking useful idiot for the banking establishment. A CBDC is authoritarian establishment cranked up to 11. Fucking gross, Liz. She’s bought and paid for. Simple as that. Beautiful I lost this post at 73.. Well I am shocked! Shocked, I say! Hopefully people see through her ideas. \\n\\nEdited for typos Decentralize the world So bitcoin is bad because it‘s backed by nothing. But their shitcoin is backed by the government. \\n\\nYea sure. I pick the government anytime over something they can’t control. /s At least it\\'s nice that her motivates are clear (remove crypto, add dystopian controllable money). Our enemy has revealed itself Another corrupt politician. Who would have guessed. Get what u vote for I suppose. Btitcoin to billion I bet she will be taking Crypto donations if enough people ask Don\\'t share anything after the question mark bro, it\\'s all for tracking. Share like this.\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/watcherguru/status/1642643472078237696 Well it looks like they\\'re not even hiding it anymore. They\\'re trying their best to control crypto and make sure we can never leave the rat race Well well well if it ain\\'t the cbdc cunt You\\'d be surprised at how many people support the idea of things like Digital ID, CBDC etc.   \\nThey literally just hate the private sector equivalents.   \\n\"You have no privacy anyways, better that the government has the info than Facebook\". Oh so crypto is only bad when the people have the power. Figures. this old globalist WEF/UN hag is pushing for anything her overlord puppet masters are ordering.\\n\\nPay for play politicians disgusting, corrupt scum. Gulag time is WAY overdue.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYou think any of these dumb morons who never had a real job know a thing about *\"the technology\"?* All they know is how to protect their power and how to f\\\\*ck us over, rob and exploit us, send our cash to their special interest groups on a daily basis. Does anyone know how much money she has raised from big banks? She’s likely been briefed by the CIA/Feds and told she has to criticize it or lose influence. It’s clear many in government now see bitcoin as the existential threat to their ability to do what they see is right. Money outside their control = people who they think are criminals transacting freely. yeah she is going to siphon everyone\\'s cash into her bank account using cbcunt dick she can fuck off She is an establishment shill.  She knows nothing about what she says, she just says it.  You will know when someone isn\\'t establishment as they will be relentlessly attacked. yes -she is not anti technology she is anti wild wild west crypto rugpull, scam, make devs insta rich. ![gif](giphy|CNna9G8BQvnoI) Oh yeah, anything to push their new CBDC agenda. We are well on our way to being forced to own nothing This feels a lot like gaslighting the more these people talk. Bitcoin is backed by trust. Which is far more than I can say about the gov and banks. No shit, she wants ultimate control of your money, which is exactly what a CBDC will accomplish. That interview is like a year old, she\\'s been pushing CBDCs since at least last year. It’s all part of the script, pass laws to outlaw crypto in America than launch new CBDC along with the new and improved/highly traceable Digital U.S. dollar.. once the threat of cryptos is gone they can move forward without saying the fiat dollar ever crashed… Of course she is but no one wants a government backed digital coin Grandma, rest. They want power so ofcourse they want CBDC Counterpoint: a U.S. CBDC would be the worlds only rock-solid USD Tethercoin, and it’s existence could greatly stabilize the crypto ecosystem by giving people a stablecoin intermediary run by the same institution that issues the FIAT that current stablecoins already claim to be backed by. She’s anti public use crypto, not anti blockchain technology.  She wants power just like everyone else it seems Oh yes the .000000000001%  Native American of Boston I\\'m telling you, Elizabeth Warren has no fundamental value 73 years old, she should not be deciding the fate of the young Damn she never stops Her biggest donors are big banks. \\n\\nI’m not surprised that she and other politicians are pushing this CBDC’s Agenda and influencing the market based on who are filling their pockets! So what? You think crypto is so weak that it can\\'t survive competition from CBDCs?\\n\\nAs long as they don\\'t ban crypto, then people have the freedom to choose. I think people who try to ban CBDCs are just tyrannical as the people they\\'re opposing.\\n\\n**Let us have freedom of choice.** I never cared for Pocahontas. Now I really don\\'t like her. Absolute worst senator of all time. I don’t care who y’all vote for next election but please don’t vote for her hypocritical authoritarian ass. Long live Crypto! She’s a whore The tyrany is blatant There should be a limit on age in the elections.\\n\\nThis will only stop the innovations. Can old people please just step away from crypto? You have fucked up the future for us enough already. Thanks. The two go hand in hand no? Elizabeth Warren be like:\\n\\nBitcoin and crypto are risky but our CBDC, which is also a digital asset, is completely fine.\\n\\nLol I was really expecting her to stop being wrong after a 73 year unbroken streak of being wrong. A shocking development. Seems to be a bot in here down voting everyone making a good point about cbdc. CBDC is bad ya dumb bot! I just have no love for this woman.  Her head is so far up her own uppity ass, it\\'s not even funny. Which of her constituents are supporting her constant bullshit? Damn them.  Do not reelect this career politician to any position in our government! Well yeah, establishment Democrats despise the idea of people having control over their lives and their money, without them being able to take it and spend it for you.\\n\\nCrypto is inherently aligned with liberal conservative political ideologies. Which makes it so interesting to see it clash with reddit and its biased, censored landscape  Then she can decide where you can spend your money and track every purchase we make.  Perfect for her “make America like China” campaign. There is no stopping the CBDC, all we can hope is that crypto is allowed to exist within regulation I understand social justice issues in America and how the Left “Champions” them but only the blind and ignorant dont see how the Democratic Party is using these issues to usher in complete and absolute Autonomy over your lives. Warren is as old school Globalist as it gets. Are you surprised that a sovereign country wants to control its own currency? Y’all crypto bros spewing random hate based on things like *checks notes* her age(?) are the reason we have a bad name. Crypto is not going to issue in some new era of financial freedom for the lower class. It’s got A LOT of problems and is rife with scams. You want it to succeed? Regulate it. Or it’s going away. \\n\\nYour most hated senator has been championing the middle and lower class and fighting the banks for her entire career. It’s her life’s work. But she has said some hard truths about something you stan, so I guess she is an evil bitch now. \\n\\nAt least get your facts straight before coming to a political conclusion. \\n\\nI await the downvotes. Pocahontes Yep Warren has no idea what shes doing and is trying to kill innovation in the US Old skunk better think about taking her dementia pills and changing her diaper.\\nWhat a 73 years old can understand about crypto… seriously She’s seriously dumb. Sick of these people in power are just bought and paid for What an evil, stupid bitch Yikes Of course! She wants the government to control everyone. And that\\'s not an exaggeration. CBDC\\'s would end freedom. Dinosaur strikes again Fake Native American is a fraud down to the DNA in her cells. Literally ![gif](giphy|6nWhy3ulBL7GSCvKw6)\\n\\nThis is a total surprise, totally did not expect her to support CBDC at all after doing recruiting for her crypto-demonising “army” /s She don’t know how crypto works These Republicans must be stopped at all costs. She is just a puppet at this point pushing the cbdc agenda Useful idiot She\\'s ridiculous.. Hand waving puppets Absolute clown just like every other politician! She is a total piece of garbage that is motivated by her self interest of being re-elected. The definition of “term limits”! Get these geriatric fossils out of government and into retirement homes. I know people hate Warren because of her stance on crypto but seriously, saying she\\'s for big banks and corps. Do you guys have any knowledge of her record? This lady is the reason the cfpb exists. I may not like her stance on crypto but imo she is one of the better politicians out there when it comes to fighting for the little guy. Sounds like we’re having CBDC flakes for breakfast 😞 What a dumb*** boomer Boo Elizabeth yeah beer She\\'s a clown. Keep voting for racist, white Democrat & progressive candidates. This is what you get Year 2040, people are still pushing the government to adapt CBDCs. I\\'m surprised she took this stance, wait no I\\'m not, she\\'s the flag carrier for the Fiat elite She is a cunt “UNITED we STAND. DIVIDED we FALL” Never forget: Control is an illusion. The people have the power. The people are the blood of any civilization. Without us, there is nothing. 73 years old... no more dinosaurs in goverment please! I can’t wait to tu watch FEDNOW fail I think she is just doing this because she thinks it gets her constituents riled up and can work well with her climate change rhetoric. \\n\\nAt some point when the idea that Bitcoin is bad for the environment dies she probably won\\'t make being anti-Bitcoin a large part of her character. Out of touch politician is out of touch. They finna mint a trillion and buy the rest of the bitcoin, just to short it forever. \\nShould be really weird to watch. I met Warren briefly several years ago in Massachusetts.  She was just as confused and insincere in real life as she appears to be on TV. She is a clown & even though I tend to lean more left. Not once has she ever came up with anything good... Of course she\\'s shilling cbdc\\'s now. 😂  I\\'m going to head over to Twitter & see how her anticrypto army is taking this. Thats a bold move cotton, lets see how that pays off. Good thing dinosaurs’ fingers are too thick to interact with technology. Liz be looking like the Crypt Keeper! Used to think \"batshit crazy\" was a GOP trait but across the isle a new contender stands up.\\n\\nShe could\\'ve joined Bernie in 2016 and become his VP. So much potential... So far astray. The point of crypto is to get rid of ach fees and lag tumes Elizabeth Karen, the queen of the crypto Karens She\\'s a kook who has a better chance of becoming Santa Claus than president. Welp guess we have to vote her out next chance we get. It’s like her campaign is to become the most hated human on the planet\\n\\nShe’s a two-bit fraud who’s never cared about the people of America. This is the main reason our country is where it is now. Crooks and con-artists fill the halls of government and the pockets of the exuberantly wealthy tyrants whom control them. And dollar is backed by what??? They keep printing it from thin air Unbelievable 73 years old... That soured the start of my day. \\nThis only strengthens my hate for the government.\\n\\n\\n\\n….  and fuck banks too. Man, she went from being one of the progressive leaders to an absolute joke over the last few years.  Very disappointing.\\n\\n\\n\\nI understand that she has a \"protect the consumer at all cost\" viewpoint, but crypto is 100% landing in her blind spot.  Crypto scams and shadiness are real, for sure, but the answer isn\\'t what she\\'s proposing.  If you want to put the governments thumb on crypto then you\\'re totally missing the point. There shouldn\\'t be old politicians. They decide about a future they don\\'t live in. Max age should be like 60. Imagine my shock! This person gets way to worked up. Not good for their health ewww. she\\'s worse than crypto grifters seriously… who elected her into office? what a huge mistake; are they gonna check the voting machines on this one?? \\n\\nmaybe this article might lighten up some people’s days….\\n\\nhttps://cryptoslate.com/op-ed-how-to-resist-cbdcs-avert-a-dystopian-future/ Warren is a cunt just like the rest of them . Fuck ‘em all Vote her out people. Honestly, the levels of hypocrisy is insane! Fun fact: Elizabeth Warren has 10s of millions in crypto.\\n\\nThe whole regulation thing is an attempt to \"dip\" the price, purchase MORE crypto and then profit from the bounce-back.\\n\\nShe\\'s an out and out fraudster. She is so goofy!!! Pochohantas is at it again. Pocahontas back at it After openly lying about her ethnicity to attain positions, you think shed be held accountable in some shape or fashion.  Instead, she continues her dumbass crusade against crypto. \"73 years old\" should Tell you everything you need to know. How about... you\\'ve had your go, you\\'re now very old and your opinion for the future doesn\\'t matter because you won\\'t be in it! Move over and let people who are very well educated, younger and know what they\\'re talking about build a better future, that involves less scumbags manipulating the system to line their own pockets. What a silly Goose. I’m shocked. _Shocked!_\\n\\nAlso, fuck Elizabeth Warren and her ilk. This is dystopian. Bitcoin prevents this. I thought it was a meme when I first saw the anti crypto army stuff Another poor old soul with dementia As expected lol\\n\\nOld bitch needs to bite the dust Part of me thinks she’s saying this stuff just to stay somewhat relevant. Politicians often believe any press if good press.\\n\\nShe knows full well that the U.S. dollar is not backed by anything but the belief that it is worth something. Stop senator Warren needs to be stopped for stopping the stopped stopcoin. Her whole life of 73 yrs has come to shilling a shitcoin. Great job E Dub, you lived graciously What a joker! You can’t make this stuff up, someone should turn this into a movie. I don\\'t see the Comedy flair... this can\\'t be real, can\\'t it? A flip flopping politician. Shocked. Guys, if it hasn’t been made clear to you yet. CBDC’s are going to be really fucking bad for the everyday person CBDC\\'s = slave money. Warren getting paid by her elite banking buddies [deleted] What .. wasnt she the one who was pro crypto world.. or did i made a mistake. Can\\'t wait for that 0.000001% staking interest!!! cant complain about us crabbing! better than dipping that\\'s for sure ! Honestly, good. Yeah that cannot be allowed to happen. The US government and other governments around the world need to be brought up to speed with the digital economy. You were the chosen one!! If a CBDC was going to be used for UBI payments, it would be difficult for me to hate it entirely I am utterly shocked. The financial elites of the United States are at this level, and the CBDC was proposed by the Chinese! The earliest application is also in China. If it wants to catch up with China, it seems that the US government still needs to work hard. Hasn’t the US always been a financial power? Why should I learn from the Chinese government instead? This level is too low I mean, it\\'s not like we didn\\'t see that coming lol “Safe.” Hah I love when the guy pointed out the painting and her only excuse was that it was different cause it was a physical item.\\n\\n\"I can throw darts at it!\" - Warren . Should be her new tagline.\\n\\nIt would have been great if he had brought up those physical bitcoins from a few years ago. Such a stupid argument, especially since CBDC\\'s won\\'t be physical.\\n\\nI can\\'t believe in it unless it\\'s on a colored piece of paper!!! 3/4 of Congress is too damn old to have a relevant opinion on anything digital. Buy Bitcoin if you want to control it so bad Well, well, well. Oh, how the turntables. CBDC is another wall for the garden we are not allowed in. We can only work in the garden at night. We are not worthy of its beauty and tranquility. If you fall asleep or stop working in the garden, it will consume you furthering its growth. Your blood is its fertilizer. 😆 I\\'m going to buck the trend for this sub that CBDCs can be a useful part of the crypto ecosystem, only to the extent that they can coexist with a wide variety of non-government controlled cryptocurrencies **AND** non-governmental stable coins.     \\n\\nThe fact that very few governments would allow that, and the US has already undermined any trust in that, makes a US controlled CBDC a non-starter as far as trust is concerned. That is going to stay the case until/unless something diffuses the potential threat of the government making crypto unviable (such as with heavy restrictions of on and off-ramps, that arguably already exist but could be made worse) and/or outlawing non-governmental crypto, pushing it entirely underground (a perpetual threat). Until either usage and/or exchange of crypto becomes so widespread and ubiquitous that it is impossible to effectively control, the threat won\\'t be neutralized. There\\'s always a motive I feel bad for Katie Porter bc she talks about her praise of Warren on her campaign trail. Sorry Katie, love you but your connection to this moron, I\\'ll be voting for Schiff. I use to be a fan of hers, but she lost me.  Her attacking BTC, I hope she loses her election. If I had 12 million in bank stocks I would too. 😞 CBDCs will be \"programmable money.\"\\n\\nNo, that doesn\\'t mean what you think it means, at least not in the U.S.\\n\\nEthereum is programmable money where a smart contract on the blockchain means the rules are defined, deterministic, and applied fairly to all who choose to participate in the contract. \\n\\nMost of us understand that to be programmable money.\\n\\nNot how CBDCs will work.  First, no blockchain, no accountability,  no requirement for deterministic rules.\\n\\n Government CBDCs will be programmable money where your money is controlled completely by the Federal Reserve/Government where their code gets to do whatever it wants to your money, and restrict how/when/where/with whom you transact.  In a database with no transparency,  no effective oversight, no auditabilty.\\n\\nNo opt in.  All applied to everyone  matter what anyone thinks.\\n\\nThrough CBDCs, the Fed and Government will be able to stuff every transaction into a data lake to profile everything about individuals and groups. Who anyone associates with, who works with who, everyones health, everyone\\'s exposure to food/drugs/media/religion/politics/disease... everything.\\n\\nIt won\\'t be dystopia day one.  Like a baby rattler, it will be cute and harmless. \\n\\nUntil it isn\\'t. Just make a coin called BIGGOV. Do a little video saying that it’s making everything fair, and putting the government back in control with a government backed coin. Then delist it and send all the coins to a burn address.\\n\\nApart from one coin and then send that coin to Elizabeth Warren. Then delete all her passwords and tell her she has to commit the seed phrase to memory. \\n\\nThen all of crypto is US government backed. Don’t be that thing you were trying to fight. Leading with her age is irrelevant. Warren is clearly being used by some entity, but I really don’t know what entity that would be. She certainly isn’t supportive of the banks. I don’t think a lot of these people, like her, have thought this out. That said this fight is going to be a rough one. The one thing, the bitcoin does that the vast majority of the successful nation states really can’t stand. Is it his once again provided a mobile bearer instrument to regular folks. Understanding how much these government types are willing to fight a thing like that is going to be very useful. because Senators are bought Well this was an obvious step I think. What a turn around... That’s because CBDCs are bad for general crypto projects and innovation Be a shame if bank runs sent people to crypto. She can have her opinion on crypto which is fine. However what i cant stand is a multi multi millionaire asking for donations to help fund her reelection campaign! Don\\'t worry, I\\'m sure she\\'ll come around once she realizes how much money she can make from her very own shitcoin pump and dump scheme This is getting out of hand, I saw this about her campaign a couple weeks ago and thought this couldn\\'t be real...  \\nCertainly they\\'re not that stupid. Who\\'s going to vote for you if you campaign this shit. Either way we can\\'t take the chance, we need to stand up now before this gets anymore outta hand Mr Robot series in a nutshell. Hope it doesnt end the same way as in chaos on the streets. Who knows. Politicians hate things they can\\'t control fully (Bitcoin/crypto). Politicians love things they have a lot of control over (CBDC).\\n\\nSimple. Why is it that US politicians are usually old as fuck? I mean, if this lady was in front of me at a grocery register, I would no shit expect her to hand over one and one quarter to the cashier and losing half of them on the ground, all while telling a shitty story and making a huge line.\\n\\nThen somehow she is a fucking senator, so she gets a say in the US\\' crypto policy? I mean, shit, she probably doesn\\'t understand how to operate a Motorola, and somehow she gets to talk about CBDCs?! They need to profit or they don’t give a fuck what you think The US need to stop having policies driven by octogenarian people. After 65 they should not be allowed to go into politics. I don\\'t think even the reincarnation of Jesus can stop CBDC\\'s. The Government does what they want when they want, regardless of how much of a fuss we put up online. They only give us the illusion of choice but anyone with a half a brain knows our votes and protests do fuck all. Sadly. „Fckkkk this crypto is a scam!!!\\n\\nPlease consider buying our coins :)“ She basically said Bitcoin is backed by nothing but only belief.\\n\\nAnd what is Fiat backed by then, Liz? Terrifying A CBDC would be cool for the government! The costs and time consumption of making a token is near zero, compared to printer machines!\\n\\nEdith:\\nI made a mistake, CBDC is not crypto, so its the more able to be manipulated after creating it for free. Dear US citizens of the Massachusetts area. \\n\\nPlease do all you can to keep her out.  Vote smart, don\\'t be a turkey voting for Christmas.\\n\\nBest regards\\nOther global crypto users.\\n\\n(Why do we care. Cmon the US does something, it ain\\'t long before the rest of the world ends up with the same thing.) It feels like we live in a surreal world the last few years. Like everybody talking how bad CBDC is and she comes out and talks about. It’s all a big comedy show. Same shit different dkhead There are so many over 70\\'s in office, I mean jeez....\\n\\nI have absolutely nothing against old people, infact I have huge respect for them, but let\\'s be honest, the mind weakens considerably not to mention that there is a huge generational gap especially when it comes to technology.\\n\\nI honestly think this world would be in a much better place if there was a sensible age cap for positions of power. Let\\'s act surprised guys... Hmmm I wonder why? Maybe something didnt work for you the 1st time so you\\'ve decided to try again with a different approach?? This woman is crazy hahaha I know something for sure if politicians says right just to left \\nWhatever they say just do the opposite and you’ll be safe Man so many great and moral young minds out there, and somehow we always end up with total idiots at the top? how is it possible that with this mentality she is a senator? Shouldn’t be shocked she follows the money like a blood hound. So does everyone else in politics tho. ![gif](giphy|UQO6uMsvea5v3Ey5Fx) If there’s something that is profitable & controllable - the government will sink its claws into it. The government always uses the words \"safe\" and \"safety\" right before they start taking away some of your rights and freedoms. They did it with the Patriot Act, they’re doing it now with the Restrict Act, and they’re trying to do it with CBDCs. \\n\\nFuck these politicians and fuck their CBDCs. I don’t see the point of defending cryptocurrency at this point. It useless and whatever the original intention, it has turned into the best thing ever for fraud and scams. I moved on years ago. All the zealots got taken for a ride and it’s time for all of us to move in. So what are CBDCS going to be exactly??? There is a lot of chatter about trying to primary Elizabeth Warren over her anti/crypto stance. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe odds of winning this are slim, but what’s more important, winning or sending a message? She says it\\'s \"backed by the government\", which are backing big banks in reality To be honest, that would be great! Looking forward to her future plans nice DEMA8 tag. lfg She will likely be gone before they come in Classic Warren. Seppo politicians are the weirdest and lamest How Is it the same as crypto if this is actually going to have real monetary value C\\'mon the decision makers know that Crypto means BTC/ETH and Inu coins and CBDC means fiat... Huge difference “Old woman yells at Bitcoin” Maybe she did some research 😂🤣😅 Watch that interview.  For someone supposedly smart, she has not spent any time even trying to learn about Bitcoin.\\n\\nThis is typical of No-coiners.  All they think about is the fiat price and externalities associated with crypto like corrupt centralized exchanges. Damn i don\\'t know what she\\'s trying to do Old woman 🤦\\u200d♂️ I hate her an unhealthy amount. Every video I see of her she is saying the most uninformed shit imaginable. \\nHere is a [Nitter link](https://nitter.net/watcherguru/status/1642643472078237696?s=21&t=keznpeB1FMhXy5HEwKSnmQ) for the Twitter thread linked above.

I rather backed by nothing than backed by America Holy fkn shit balls, colour me surprised!!! /s Old hag at it again. Ugh Dusty ass grandma needs to take a seat, not a seat of power either! Of all the problems the US are facing, of all the things she should be mad at, of all the battles she could be a voice for, she chose to throw a fit at crypto. \\n\\nWhat a way to state how outdated you are. CBDC is backed by inflation, greaaaat Cunt Anybody that considers CBDCs a remotely good idea don\\'t understand Bitcoin in the first place. if she is cbdc spokes person then crypto for the win If I’m 73 and still working, someone just put me down. This is the government in a nut shell.  They need to controll it or they don\\'t give a fuck what you think. Technically, CDBC is riding on cryptographic hash functions too, no? So, a centralized Crypto is good, and decentralized crypto is bad- because she needs to pay back her lobbyist? Anything backed by the government, we totally trust that /s People like this has a lot of opinions, but not a lot of brain cells to back it up. I wish people would stop giving her column inches and air time. I can’t stand her! She’s the mean English teacher every high-school has and hates! Bitcoin maxis aren\\'t ready for Bitcoin to become a currency.   They bring up the pizza guy every time you even suggest using it to purchase something. Maybe we should be thanking her lol 🤷\\u200d♂️\\n\\nEdit: /s\\n\\nShe’s so damn annoying AUDIT THE FEDERAL RESERVE. Nothing is backed by anything besides faith.  Money is not a religion. I trust bitcoin over banks.\\n\\nEdit: furthermore bitcoin is world wide as opposed to a world bank. owned by the people. I’ll take that any day. This is dystopian. Bitcoin prevents this No offense, but people really need to admit that being backed by the government is a real benefit. \\n\\nIn my opinion, crypto hasn\\'t solved trust in real-world everyday use cases very well (and definitely not bitcoin), because at the end of the day, you need an arbiter with power to get things done, and some people, specifically people who actually move a lot of money, like that guarantee. \\n\\nThe US dollar has gotten so far because you get the full force of the US military. With Bitcoin, you get a bunch of grumpy people on twitter and Reddit (me included).\\n\\n(i own btc, ltc, eth & algo - and have not voted or donated for/to Elizabeth Warren) backed by the economic might of the US, not backed by the government. You can see the difference in the value of zim bucks. The value of our money comes from our economy, not the fact our government is called US of A. The reason people buy our tbills is they think over the long term, the US economy will keep expanding. Thats what they mean by backed by the US gov.\\n\\nand got to love this sub. \"CBDC is nothing like crypto.. its shit\" followed by \"warran is a hypocrite for supporting CBDC and not crypto\" well which is it? Oopsie! I\\'m sure her fans didn\\'t notice it tho. Also, don\\'t people ever retire in the US? I mean she\\'s 73, doesn\\'t she have grandkids to take care of or something? I mean they can just no vote for her in cali? Whos she up against and why does she always win? Why won’t you pesky plebs just stfu and trust the government…?\\n\\n- every rich politician Backed by the government? What could possibly go wrong? /s The ignorance of that old hag. Jesus Christ So same shit with a different color lmao Haha, nicely done lady She really said identical technology? America needs a much better class of politicians across the board. She is dangerous uneducated, or she is dangerously educated and richer for it. \\n\\nIn either case, anyone who values freedom needs to oppose anyone who wants CBDCs to be the future — they are surveillance capitalism realized: a true 1984 technology — and combined with AI they will be the unstoppable force that cements power with the elite with no realistic possibility of recourse. Lol, she says if there\\'s a run on a CBDC there will be someone there to back it up, implying a run on Bitcoin wouldn\\'t be backed.\\n\\nSpoiler: with real adoption there is no need for a run on Bitcoin because the supply is fixed and immune from disappearing into thin air, unlike fiat. \\n>Bitcoin was bad because it was backed by “nothing,”\\n\\nWhat exactly is the US dollar backed by since the inception of the fractional reserve banking system? Sounds like an Obamacare = bad, but i sure like that ACA type of situation To be more precise, let\\'s not say Bitcoin is backed by nothing and CBDC by government, better say Bitcoin is backed by P2P miners and CBDC by centralized government. They always say its not backed up by anything. The US dollar is backed by what? It\\'s engrained in peoples mind that 10 dollar is worth 10 dollar. I really don’t understand how these politicians think of the people who read/listen to all the nonsense they are saying??? We live in a sims game This 100%.\\n\\nThe focus is generational, only 60-70 years old could listen to this senator; but i am not so sure in regarda to millenials and Gen Z, they know that the system is a big scam when talking about crypto. Backed by the government, they mean the printing machine? The dollar is \"backed\" by trust, how is that different than nothing, lol. oh yay, the old reliable republic.  I don\\'t fkn think so there Karen Warren. and the US dollar is backed by... Holy shit Arbitrum really reached the point of catching strays in different topic posts 😂 Wrong, the only constituents they care about time and time again are the rich and corporate constituents as they contribute money to their campaigns and income. Normal people don\\'t contribute enough to be a deciding factor in moving politicians\\' behavior. Yeah, they only care about your opinion if you are rich. When do we get our airdrop for participating? It\\'s like a big, stupid game of pretend democracy. They even do USD airdrops from time to time, pretty much on point ... what they (banks and big corps) want ... And they\\'re using our money to do so >The government is like the Arbitrum DAO\\n\\nIs it? The DAO\\'s proposal [lost 82.94% to 14.08%](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3be7368a662d1cf12fa4da768d626edbc013be0dc7b994fef2e24d9a54e4033a) (with 2.99% abstaining) after the community got up in arms. This is true only if you follow their policies. If collectively we decide to deviate or resist, there is nothing they can do. Control is an illusion. They care what their rich donors think. Not the voters tho 😡 I don\\'t really understand DAO votes anyway, more tokens means more voting power? That doesn\\'t sound fair. Sounds like every government, not just the US imho Always has been this way sadly Yep, but I guess in the government\\'s perspective the massive control over people would probably make up for the issues CBDCs would cause to the banking system. Yes and quite surprising how the big banks haven\\'t protested against it yet atleast not openly. No they would operate like wallets do as far as the equivalent to bank. Banks aren\\'t primarily a place to store your money, they are basically moneylenders. They want to replace the exchanges and more easily track transactions, and actually be able to fully control them. But it wouldn\\'t remove the need of a govt now would it It\\'s all about control, that\\'s the only thing they care about. CBDC will pave the way to \"expiry dates\" and \"allowed spending categories\" Seems there will be CBDC for financial institutions and another for the regular U.S. population. Insert shocked pikachu face meme Nothing new under the sun We are fucked, aren\\'t we? Who\\'s the rival? Why are people re-electing a 73 year old anyway?

Then she took a DNA test, and it revealed that she was whiter than the average white american.

Right? /s It’s also the IRS’s favorite coin! Lol the people in those colonies couldnt even vote if they were poor. Don\\'t act like the US was built to be some egalitarian paradise. The government was intentionally designed as a weapon of the rich against the poor. And then somehow force everyone else to use it and take away the cash Is he running for something tho? No way! /s I bet she will be a safemoon shiller too \"It\\'s government-approved, so you know it\\'s good!\" *Luna Classic reaches new ATH* She\\'s got more bank money behind her than a Vegas casino which is hilarious because she\\'s been squawking about going after banks forever.  Don\\'t listen to what people say, just watch what they do. The banks are a much bigger systemic risk currently but you will never hear that.

Outlaw crypto and we will be forced to watch other countries advance in crypto and potentially watch millions of ppl migrate out of America once they wake up No one has to use it … we can just use Bitcoin for peer to peer payments plus there’s plenty of websites and companies that are willing to take it Happy cake day down!

You\\'ve earned it. 🤣🤣🤣 This lady belongs in the looney house. gtfo.\\n\\nthe US government could, for example, put a time limit on the amount of time you can hold your tax return before it is worthless.  Fuck that. CBDC will only run on FedNow and controlled by the government like FIAT on steroids, anything related to crypto is hunted with operation chokepoint 2.0. Counter counterpoint: fuck fiat I like your point. Since BTC is global everyone could still use across all the different countries while having a U.S. coin. This could increase rapid adoption. Stablecoins are a fucking cancer. And she will continue. That\\'s what her donors want [deleted] term limits Why restrict choice? If you don\\'t want old candidates, don\\'t vote for them and old people will stop running. ~~crypto~~ government. You must be new here and haven’t heard what CBDCs are? Hey guys look, Elizabeth warren made an appearance in the thread! The crypto community welcomes regulation.  Unfortunately, these 80 year old politicians and their appointed regulators are too ignorant to provide it.\\n\\nAs a obvious Boomer yourself, you may think you understand the fiat system but you really don’t.  Not only do you not understand the system but are ignorant to how politicians and the media keep you ignorant.\\n\\nThe media makes you think crypto is about the get rich quick crowd and corrupt exchanges, it isn’t.  None of that has anything to do with Bitcoin.  Bitcoin does not care about anything and is not dependent on anything.\\n\\nElizabeth Warren is not “fighting the banks”.  She is profiting from them and staying in power by a bunch of liberal platitudes and bromides. https://www.ledgerinsights.com/nigeria-enaira-cbdc-transactions-surge/ India has already started the pilot run as well . There was a report here . But it hasn’t gained much traction yet .  There are several other countries in G20 is also working with IMF and india for regulations. It’s matter of time until many of them start rolling it out . Are you living under a rock?! The eNaira in Nigeria is out and the government is turning full steam against cash, China is also trying to roll out its CBDC but so far less successfully.\\n\\nhttps://www.ledgerinsights.com/nigeria-enaira-cbdc-transactions-surge/\\n\\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/china-doles-out-millions-in-digital-yuan-in-bid-to-boost-adoption-report\\n\\nGovernments are very progressed and just wait for a moment (probably a fabricated one) to find an excuse to introduce them. Well she is, like pretty much every politician, super rich. They need to lord their privilege over everyone and we\\'re not allowed to believe in anything. And we thought Arbitrum DAO had problems We having a choice in any matter is just an illusion, in the end we\\'re sheeps or at least forced to be one. Yet 90% of this sub supports regulating the non-governmental cryptos. That is definitely what congress does. Regulates stuff. If regulation came from the civil servants (not political appointees), then we\\'d have a chance. More like you can\\'t make money of it i want a slice of the pie as well. Politicians like Ted Cruz and Ron DeSantis are trying to ban CBDC\\'s. So it isn\\'t the end of the world. Just use your voting power. The government\\'s always got to have their hands in your cookie jar. The reason why there is a push for CBDC is to be able to use the modernized SWIFT which the entire global financial system relies up. \\n\\nSwift is going digital and will require this.\\n\\nThis is the sole reason. Also the government: we want to control something that we have no idea what in the fuck it is unfortunately a good portion of the population either doesn\\'t know this or don\\'t believe it. CBDC is not crypto, is electronic USD run on FedNow. I can\\'t see any blockchain positives of CBDCs other than eliminating stablecoins? It’s not a crypto.\\n\\nIt’s a modernized system to be used in SWIFT. It is absolutely needed.\\n\\nThe world relies upon SWIFT and swift is shifting over to a new digital system (which also kills any use of Ripple)\\n\\nThis is needed just for SWIFT useage She is smart enough otherwise she wouldn\\'t have been in her position. It\\'s just that they don\\'t move a needle unless they were bribed aka lobbied for it I don\\'t care about her Her constituents are backing her and want her to speak on this topic. I imagine this is going on with politicians around the country. E.W. Is just one of more high profile speaking out in it. Is this good or bad??? omg 100% accurate description\\n\\nher facial expression is always as if she has just bit into a lemon They don\\'t want a useable currency. They want to gamble like the rest of us. People in crypto love to pretend that crypto is a rival to fiat, but no one actually wants it to behave that way. That\\'s why you see people talking about fiat in one post and then talking about pumps and dumps and candles in the other. They pretend it\\'s currency for the optics, but then they treat it like a casino. The unfortunate thing is that some people who never used crypto and bought into the ‘crypto bad’ narrative pushed by the media would simply believe what Dinosaur Warren says.. The dollar being backed by \"the full faith and credit of the U.S. government\" still means something and a CBDC would probably be stable and prove useful, especially for the \"unbanked\" (people who can\\'t get bank accounts for whatever reasons). I can kind of understand the fear that the government could use it in ways we don\\'t want (eg, tracking spending, using to tax us on more transactions, and potentially block spending on certain things or based on a social credit score) but I kind of think they could do that now with the banking system but maybe it would be a lot easier with a CBDC. \\'money being backed/abused by government is a real benefit\\' \\n\\nTell that to anyone living in Venezuela, Argentina, Turkey, Nigeria, etc etc. >No offense, but people really need to admit that being backed by the government is a real benefit.\\n\\nAnyone who wants to use government backed money has cash and a credit card already. They are not crypto\\'s target audience. In the interview, she literally said “backed by the government.” \\n\\nAlso, nobody in this sub said CBDC’s are “nothing” like crypto. It’s more that they are perversion of crypto and use the underlying technology but stripped away the freedom aspect of crypto. She’s from MA. Republicans rarely win national office (though governors flip between R and D). If any Democrat challenged her, it’d be political suicide. Yes Yup pretty much the trend of the day at this point. Shit they still freebied me 1k+ out of the blue though, so I can’t hate on them too hard. They kinda fucked up hard ignoring community vote despite the \"governance\". it\\'s definitely meme worthy for a few weeks. *if you\\'ve donated large sums of money to them. Well with Arbitrum, they don\\'t care if you\\'re rich or poor, Putin all the way!!! They only care about your opinion if you\\'re a lobbyist giving them $$$$. Corrupt as #@$&! Weren’t you around during COVID? Exactly. Tbh I\\'d be happy with one less middleman, especially if crypto still exists as an alternative. This whole narrative that CBDCs are going to exert more control over people\\'s financial situations is such a lackluster argument. \\n\\n\\nhttps://www.ledgerinsights.com/digital-pound-cbdc-not-programmable-government-control/\\n\\n\"CBDCs will not be “anonymous money”, Ms. Fortune said. “However, the objective is that the central bank and the government would not be able to access that information. That would be done by this private sector layer.”\\n\\nThe goal is to create interoperability and prevent fragmentation when dealing with different forms of money, as the article states. It isn\\'t about suveillance - the government already has that. Maybe the banks would be glad to not have to handle checking accounts and debit transactions. It\\'s a lot of work to manage those transactions for little reward for them, especially with free checking accounts. Maybe they would be happy to primarily deal with savings, investments, and loans. They make money on those. They are certainly trying to screw us over. Let’s hope they fall flat on their faces. Dont know, people were just saying we should fund a pro crypto rival. And I think giving any politician more money is insanity. At least a cognitive test to be allowed to run for office’ 65 should be the cut off for politicians. Basically retirement age for most professions, but in the US it\\'s like the minimum age requirement lol. There\\'s a reason most people retire in their mid-late 60\\'s, so why the fucking fuck are these the people leading the most powerful nation on Earth?\\n\\nNot only are your cognitive abilities going to rapidly drop, but you\\'re at an age where basically nothing will affect you. You could argue that their kids might be affected, however in many cases their families are insulated from the worst effects or they simply don\\'t give a fuck. Probably because tons of elderly people are represented by her and Democrats/Liberals tend to not really vote smart. From what I\\'ve learned on political subs is that they vote strategically instead of voting for a politician they like, ABC (Anything But Conservative) is the usual strategy and you end up with turds like her. That\\'s how we got Biden. \\n\\n(I live in Canada and we have the biggest turd of them all as Prime Minister, and I don\\'t even vote Liberal or Conservative) 😂😂😂 Which is just as stable as banks these days I mean... All of the successful stable coins are literally pegged to the USD. The USD already underpins all of crypto anyway. You really are ignorant. She would shill you dogshit if government said it was good to you 99% of all coins are scams and securities.\\n\\nonce Ripple loses to the sec the slow demise will start maybe BTC lives but most will be worth pennies on the dollar. which is why cryptos best days are in the past....btc could be the exception It\\'s a very sad political situation we must endure. Eh, my generation said the same thing and then a new bunch of greedy dinosaurs from our midst rose up to take their place. There will always be fuckwads of all ages ready to take the job. 1934 Gold Reserve Act, 2024 Digital Reserve Act 👀 If only the fed agreed with us Thanks. If the average Joe adapts to CDBCs because they are easy to use then crypto failed anyway. It has had so many opportunities to be user friendly, so if it gets beaten by CDBCs then it only has itself to blame. Fortunately, I don’t see it happening any time soon. Both. Both is good. An obvious boomer 😂 Pretends to fight for the little guy like she pretends to be native American And this is another reason why we must fight with all we got to reject CBDCs which are direct thread to our freedom. Say goodbye to privacy if CBDCs succeed. It is only created to give full control to govs. Scary af. She will lose most of her supporters who have bitcoin in their balance sheet This is the \"never try, never fail\" mentality. The Loser\\'s mentality. ![gif](giphy|QXUettGoetn7Bo4Rqo|downsized)\\n\\nSomebody who gets me! Politicians like Ted Cruz and Ron DeSantis are trying to ban CBDC\\'s. Use your voting power. They do. It\\'s not a DAO but a centralized rugpull attempt. \\n\\nThe government is the same, but they pulled the rug long ago. They make you believe there is a rug but the truth is we are all sitting on the floor. Overall, CBDC is still using cryptographic hash functions. e-USD may not be using blockchain, but other Digital Currencies are developed through Ethereum, Corda, Hyperledger Fabric and Quorum.\\n\\nCanada for example worked on Project Jasper/CAD coin in 2016, and they used Ethereum. Project Ubin by Singapore in 2016 used Ethereum, Corda, Hyperledger Fabric, and Quorum - all are cryptographic hash functions.\\n\\nEuropean Central Bank through Project Stella in 2017 uses blockchain too.\\n\\nThe US utilizes FedNow, overall, CDBC runs through private blockchain. If that is the case then EU has CBDC already. I mean FedNow just seems like SEPA to me. \\n\\nI think a real CBDC would need to be like non-custodial but still under bank control. FedNow seems to be just a way to transfer from bank to bank It depends on which side you\\'re looking at. From a governmental perspective, this is good for them as stablecoins create that opportunity for another provider to play the role of a central bank.\\n\\nBy having CBDC, the sovereign state could very well go - \"OK, this digital currency is going to be your only sole point of entry and exit on crypto\". This way, they can trace your ins and outs, and you cannot escape the taxation, and future policies.\\n\\nThe good part of this is that- it will emulate the usage of the currency (In one case, e-USD) similar to how dollar notes are used, except that now it is digital, and you can even get your credit score updated on day-to-day basis. This could create the ease of the masses to join in, and use crypto.\\n\\nThe drawback is- this is the sole thing we wanted to escape from, the tyranny of the elites controlling the monetary cashflow. Hence, if CDBC is the standard, we\\'re gonna have a TradFi dome over DeFi. It has the benefits of crypto (portability, ease of handling / transfering, makes banks as intermediaries unnecessary) without the downsides (price volatility, scams, still needing banks as intermediaries most of the time). \\n\\nThere\\'s also monetary / security advantages from the government\\'s perspective with having deposits at the Fed and owning all of the transaction tracking / monitoring. Or like she has some shit under nose ![gif](giphy|Y13nUUFDhYRbv0JSlm)\\n\\nThere goes the curve. How many F22s they have? Which is what everybody knew was going to happen. Even the most anti-crypto people don’t hate the technology from what  I have read, they just don’t know it’s best use case yet. Best believe they want the tech though. Lol, it is an ad to bitcoin! Shouldn’t be hating at all! I didn’t get zip. That\\'s why SBF donated to everyone, he knew the rules and tried to cover all of his bases CBDC’s are evil incarcerate. \\n\\nDo you want your money to be able to have an expiration date? Because that’s what they’ll be able to do. Want your funds to be frozen because you’re a *suspect* in a case? Done. Giving the government power over your bank account is not “one less middleman” it’s giving up your freedom. China did … Do we even know how much these people are getting? The worst part is that she is very much aware of what she is doing. She’s just an evil shit. Or a psychopathy test Power The country is basically run by semi brain-dead corrupt dinosaurs *Credit Suisse cries in the distance* It\\'s literally in the constitution. Look up the debates between Madison and Paine regarding the right to vote. It\\'s pretty explicit with regards to *why* they were antidemocratic shit heads. There was nothing noble about a bunch of rich guys making themselves an oligarchy to replace the monarchy. If only we actually used it instead of sitting on it hoping it increases in value. And an obvious political partisan who watches way too much CNN and MSNBC with no ability to think for yourself.\\n\\nNo young, politically independent person under 70, could possibly not see Warren as anything other than a misinformed clown. Pretends to fight for the little guy, but in reality they FIGHT the little guy. That sounds just like the leader of my province in Canada (she got called out for faking being Native and Ukrainian). Fake it till you make it. She’s a dumb fucking human . No Politician does anything that creates value or substance to peoples lives they are useless human beings just out for themselves . The dregs of society doesn’t matter what side of the aisle either Everyone else:\\n\\n![gif](giphy|3xz2BLBOt13X9AgjEA) I love it. You say the same thing on /antiwork or /whitepeopletwitter and you’d have 3,539 downvotes in about an hour. Government hungry politicians are enemies of the little guy. Screw the fake Indian. It is scary. I like transparency, but I also like privacy and especially not having a corporate entity know exactly how much money I have and how I spend it (even more than they already know).\\n\\nI hope they create it and it just fails miserably. I like crypto and I like cold hard cash. I don\\'t want my fiat to disappear into a digital currency (unless of course it\\'s my decision 🤣) and it loses fungibility. I don\\'t like any separate entity having total control over my assets.\\n\\nThis is unconstitutional!! People don\\'t get it, you do something the government doesn\\'t like, and who knows once they get more monetary control what laws the would implement, off go the taps, no more spending for you. Crazy to think people would switch sides over a decision like this, but it\\'s a pretty big one. It\\'s one thing to be anti-crypto, that\\'s fair, but CBDCs are not even close to a good replacement. I like the innovation of cryptocurrencies. Most people see shitcoins, memecoins, scams, money laundering, wire fraud, larceny, they just give up and not give it a chance; I see the innovation outside of the economics, where the technology lies and it\\'s pretty extreme. This is a technological Zion governed by the ones that create/support it instead of being ran/directed by those that control it. This is isn\\'t just finance this is the future of advancement. ![gif](giphy|VGVwLultLZjrrssAak) Yeah but they are both also super terrible for other reasons. Ron DeSantis banned books 🤣.\\n\\nI understand the sentiment tho. are they mined? Already been confirmed by the government CBDC on FedNow won\\'t run on any blockchain technology, cryptographic hash functions mean nothing if the government and central banks have control of your money. The opposite of decentralized blockchains as Bitcoin or Ethereum which you have total control with ultrasound money. A private blockchain that’s centralized is just a typical database EU already has been working of their own, see https://cbdctracker.org/\\n\\nU.S. CBDC will run on FedNow. All I can comprehend from this comment is I\\'ll have to yolo into this CBDC coin whenever it launches\\n\\n^/s in case it isn\\'t obvious I agree entirely, except I don’t think the tracking and control will stop at crypto ramps. I can see this being used to control spending on things like cigarettes, alcohol and gambling, use it to build a profile of your personal carbon footprint and stop you from making purchases if you go over a certain budget, like limiting fuel purchases for your car, freeze bank accounts of protesters and people the government generally doesn’t like. All manner of government control is possible with a CBDC.\\n\\nI wish I sounded like a conspiracy theorist cooker, but a few years ago it would have been unthinkable that the government would confine entire populations to their homes and send out riot police to arrest and shoot protestors, but here we are Lol what? Tether can\\'t change federal interest rates. Nor can they affect the supply of USD. What are you talking about? True enough. But if they did their research, they\\'d know that practically none of cryptocurrency usage is used for illicit activities. This would eliminate them from having to do \"any actual fucking work\" though, but I highly doubt anyone would even use it, even if it was implemented? I just want to see them put in all this work and then watch it crash/burn. Elizabeth Warren in Morbius 2!\\n\\nI only see CBDCs as a way for the US Government to launder their debt and keep embezzling money for \"just a little bit longer\", because they\\'ve been doing such a great job so far... US Government: Trust me bro! Diocletian had the most powerful army in human history up to that point at his disposal and even he couldn\\'t stop inflation by fiat. And managed to fuck it up anyway. This is also probably why he is still not behind the bars And just like the government, he used your money to donate. All of those things can be done with normal banks and can be circumvented with crypto. [deleted] I wish she would leave Crypto alone and go back to pretending she’s Native American. It\\'s like all of them. In the US, it\\'s especially bad, like you HAVE TO BE 50+ to even run, most people of their age just infinitely stay in their positions once elected.\\n\\nI swear the Republicans just want to see America burn. Property owners - had nothing to do with bank account size, but had everything to do with property ownership (and the paying of taxes upon that property). Those who owned no property effectively had no skin in the game. Quite simple. Hello, I\\'m from the IRS, I\\'m here to help you. they *steal* from the little guys We need to get rid off those dinosaurs. Sounds like a tipical politician. Why always these kind of people got elected everywhere in the world? BC? lol Gotham is 100% floating a crypto race between Batcoin and Hahalgorand No they aren\\'t, all the do is offer more fkn control to the government and lord knows they have too much already. Is this about the children booke that contain inappropriate stuff? Lol Good question- but honestly, I do not know. No Last time I yoloed in the government,  still fuckingme up till this date TBH, considering how CDBC will influence the market, we should try to understand how to game it. Yolo when it de-pegs We are looking at two different problem statements there. \\n\\nCrypto will trickle down a bit in terms of development the moment that there\\'s the same amount of paperwork needed through CDBC for crypto trades. That\\'s my assumption. CBDC has the potential to see that happening.\\n\\nAs for spending on cigarettes, and other items- I do agree with you on that matter. You do sound like a conspiracy nut. Could they do all these things with a regular bank account if they wanted to? Fiat is already mostly electronic (debit cards, credit cards, bank transfers etc. ). I personally hardly ever use cash. I\\'m curious as to how a CBDC would be different. It seems like just another way to spend my money, and a good option for people who are \"unbanked\" (those who for whatever reason can\\'t get a bank account). If you view tether in TradFi structure, no, it cant. If you view it in DeFi structure, we have seen similar facilities on tether that emulates fix deposits, loan facilities, and it functions (with limitations) on how a bank would function in DeFi structure. > they\\'d know that practically none of cryptocurrency usage is used for illicit activities.\\n\\nThey\\'re not gunning for illicit activities. CBDC has the potential to outline everyone\\'s monetary behaviour. They want that information. It\\'s a nice circular design for them though. Make it more onerous to use crypto for most transactions and its only when you need secrecy (mostly illegal stuff) that people will use it. Then use the illegal transactions to justify further regulation. if private crypto had been done competently people wouldn’t be looking to the government, but alas Narrator: And that\\'s how this LoL noob fucked up real bad That\\'s why he is not afraid to fuck up, because he already paid the right people Not really, as he’s unlikely to get a sentence his crimes would get someone else.\\n\\nYou don’t spend time buddying with White House and SEC, and get treated like normal people. Cos he was messing with CZ, lol He made every wrong decision he couldve *This is why\\n\\nFTFY >\"And just like the government, he used your money to donate.\"\\nAnd for the record, this is how corporations operate. The profits generated by the workers are used by boards of directors to undercut the needs of their workers, by donating to pass anti-worker legislation. They absolutely cannot. You can withdraw your money and hold cash. CBDC’s enable the central bank to put a time limit on the money in your account if they choose meaning no savings or cash alternative. And that’s just scratching the surface of the level of control CBDC’s would give the government versus the current banking system. \\n\\nIt’s the worst thing that could happen and should be avoided/protested at all cost LMAO\\n\\nAs though the real money doesn\\'t come from PACs and slush funds through dark channels... No no, I meant the bribe And who owned property? The rich. Once again, you can look up the debates. Or HR is here for you and your concerns Hello IRS guy, I\\'m dad. Are you sure you\\'re here to help The agent says menacingly as he conceals a sharp dagger behind his back. Because they have to associate themselves with a certain class\\' shortcomings/discrimination to remain relevant. Why can\\'t we cancel politicians? Because they know people, and they know people. &#x200B;\\n\\nThey got the money. That\\'s all you need to get elected in this world. Well libraries are basically banned and Florida is treading on the Nazi line. Maybe if DeSantis wasn\\'t full-on alt-right fringe, it\\'d be a better support model. Doubtful....more than likely \"issued\" to those who \"deserve\" them (or know the right people in the right places)\\n\\nWealth inequality would not change if they had their way I would rather yelling into shitcoins I think you assume right. But we’ll know soon enough. CBDCs offer government a level of control that is going to prove irresistible. So they will happen and probably sooner rather than later. With that in mind it makes sense to put some cash into the crypto economy now and get ahead of it Doing all that stuff right now would require the cooperation of a bank, a commercial enterprise with a financial interest in not doing that. CBDCs would allow government and central banks to circumvent the banks and control your spending directly. The problem also get infinitely worse if they decide to do away with cash and make all payments digital. Cash still needs to be an option, but a CBDC would then be able to control your access to cash. \\n\\nSo the real problem is that a CBDC gives control of your money directly to the government and unelected bureaucrats Tethers price is tied to the USD directly. That\\'s it\\'s utility. To claim that they have any resemblance to the fed is nonsense. The Fed could tank tethers price overnight. They are trying to essentially enact the Patriot Act in finance because literally no one can do anything to stop them! This is unregulated territory and the SEC is on their side. If no regulatory body steps in to stop or at least oversee their activities, then total trust will be lost in the government (as if they fucking had any left?).\\n\\n1984. Maybe it\\'s deliberate to force people to use other methods of offramps that border on \"illegal\" so they can condemn crypto and push the Petro Dollar?\\n\\nThis is a great use-case for Monero. I\\'m just waiting for them to start banning networks from operating in the US next! He’s the epitome of bronze trash Or the police is either capable or willing to deter or solve crimes that involve actual harm like, oh I don\\'t know, rape, murder, robberies. In places with elections that aren\\'t entirely for show or simply an alien concept (Russia, China, etc) politicians get cancelled fairly frequently, but it\\'s not always done in good faith. Parties are as likely to cancel a Dennis Hastert (for paying hush money to cover up a history of child molestation) as a Justin Amash (for sticking to his principles and also stating the obvious). Lol i sometimes forget just how far left wing Reddit is. But honestly, those guys trying to ban it and the likes of Warren endorsing it just goes to show which side really cares about our freedoms Wealth inequality won\\'t change as long as capitalism exists. Inequality is built into the system at a fundamental level, and crypto (any kind of crypto) does nothing to change that. In all cases, the medium of exchange means nothing. It\\'s the material ownership over the things we all need to live that gives them their power, and as long as that exists, nothing will change it. Bitcoin mining is done predominantly by extremely wealthy people who can afford to build giant mining facilities. ETH mining is done based on who has the most ETH available to stake. How is that any different than anything else in society when it comes to inequality? The rich love crypto, because it\\'s an easy way to separate the poor from their money. But what if the government eventually bans all crypto except a government coin? Yeap. I still firmly believe that crypto is the way to go. Countries are now chasing each other to this \\'arms race\\' on who can attain the most market share- no different to how they could secure resources for energy security.\\n\\nIt\\'s the new age of mining, and it is financial security which focuses on \\'illicit\\' outflow  (Based on government\\'s definition). That make sense. That kind of control could be bad if used against people, in the wrong hands. Imagine playing LoL so much that you end up screwing up everything for everyone with your project and yet you managed to get placed in Bronze III\\n\\nr e k t I just vote for my party, the one that I love, even though they\\'ll probably never win. I assume most voters are actually Libertarian, but sacrifice their values for a realistic outcome. Meeting true Liberals and Conservatives are few and far between. Well they can’t ban crypto, only your ramps on and off. But I’m betting that crypto already circulating will make the shift from speculative investment to currency if enough people lose faith in fiat which could very well happen if governments come in and over reach as they are inclined to do US is not the only country on this planet\\n\\nand you think other countries willing to use US cbdc as their international currency? With so much control over it? That it can be confiscate whenever US wants?\\n\\nYou think they are not thnking twice now about holding USD? Seeing that Russia can be embargoed with swift?

Nope. Gold bars/coins? Well sure, but gonna be a hassle to check a container full of gold bars for authenticity every time they di transactions. Bitcoin? Bingo I don\\'t see how they would ban all crypto. They would however ban stablecoin because that would bring relevant to e-USD under CBDC. \\n\\nOn top of this, they will probably impose a strict KYC for new coins, linked with CDBC database by making SBF and Do Kwon as exhibit A and B. US is not the only country on this planet\\n\\nand you think other countries willing to use US cbdc as their international currency? With so much control over it?

Nope. \\n- Gold bars/coins? Not really, gonna be a hassle to check a container full of gold bars for authenticity every time they do transactions. Who can be trusted to store them? Swiss? Same problem all over again.\\n- Bitcoin? Bingo It all feels like a misstep. The government is rarely the right hands… unless you’re a rich donor of course [removed] Anything is possible. It would be a nightmare in the US to do the required tax reporting on the cost basis for every transaction if used as a currency since the IRS doesn\\'t view crypto currency as a currency but more like a stock share with a cost basis and is held either long or short term in relation to capital gains taxation. >and you think other countries willing to use US cbdc as their international currency? \\n\\nyou think they willingly use the dollar now? The US government at one time banned owning gold (Executive Order 6102) so it\\'s not inconceivable that they could ban owning crypto currency, using reasons that it has negative effects on the dollar, US economy, and facilitates crime including illegal purchases, tax evasion, money laundering, etc. \\n\\nThey could order exchanges to keep track of transactions, cost basis, etc., and issue annual tax forms such as are required for other investments. In fact, I think I read that they will be required to do tax reporting as of [2023](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-taxes/whats-new-crypto-tax-regulation). Interesting. But isn\\'t BTC too volatile to be used as currency? The USD is fairly stable and for the most part trusted around the world, except for countries that are likely to be sanctioned. So maybe a US CBDC would be adopted by the countries that trust the dollar. \\n\\nI just read that China limits how much their citizens can spend on things outside their country ($50,000 annually as of the date of the article) and yet the citizens use BTC to circumvent that limit. I could see China banning their citizens from using BTC for that reason. I don\\'t know how they\\'ll figure out who is using it, but if they can figure that out, they will punish anyone who is doing it.  The US could also ban it for lots of reasons that have been written about (national security, tax evasion, illegal purchases, money laundering, etc.) or they could make it only legal to use KYC exchanges that are compliant with US regulations. That\\'s a rather cynical view. You could be right though. I\\'m just not that cynical. I believe there are bad players and well meaning players and \"better than the alternative\" players in government and the US government mostly works, although it arguably works better for people who have more resources.

It\\'s different. From 70s to 2007, number of USD in circulation was stable at 800billion. In 2008? 2 trillion. In 2023? 9 trillion.

Every other countries are paying attention If you follow the btc price, the volatility wont be for long. It will stable out in the next decade (or sooner)... basically the more it being used, the more institution/corporation/countries use it, the more stable it gets.\\n\\nAlso, if you see 200, 500-day average, bitcoin is steadily going up.\\n\\nAs for USD, no.. it seems stable since we use it as measurement compared to other currency, but if you compare it to, lets say, bigMac,  it was 60 cents in the 70s, $2.5 just 10 years ago, and $5 today.\\n\\n $10 in 2013 can buy you 4 bigmac, now only 2.\\n\\nImagine countries holding hundred of millions of USD in their reserve, basically like losing 50% of purchasing power in 10 years. These people have spent a couple decades invading foreign nations and drone bombing civilians, including children, weddings, and hospitals. They\\'ve deliberately destabilized entire regions condemning thousands upon thousands to death and displacement. They\\'ve spied on and collected data on every American citizen. Then the politicians of both parties just pass the very acts that allow this, like the Patriot Act and NDAA, over and over again. And they aren\\'t even close votes. They have huge bipartisan support everytime they come to the floor.\\n\\nWith that track record, I\\'d say I have a lot of reason to be cynical and would argue you\\'re a bit naïve to think that there are any good player, or at least, that any of these good players actually have any influence at all. I may be naïve. I don\\'t know enough about the examples you provided to know how much Congress members knew would happen at the command of the few top players when they voted for acts that allowed the actions to be made. I imagine the president has a lot of leeway in making decisions that remain secret, so that few, if any Congress members ever know about calls that were made at top levels. How many Congress members knew the extent of collected data that Snowden blew the whistle on? I believe that most members of Congress make the best decisions they can with the information they are given at the time, with the exception of the more ignorant members who have been elected in more recent years and members who vote based on their personal interests. I like to think that the system has enough checks and balances to keep everything on a mostly even keel. I think you are missing the part where I said they keep re-upping these things. Even after hearing about the terrible things happening, they go in and vote for things like the Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act time and time again. They know and vote for it anyway.'"

       "' She was interviewed and talked about how Bitcoin was bad because it was backed by “nothing,” and how CBDC’s would be great because it’s identical technology but backed by the government. \\n\\nIt was an accidental ad for Bitcoin The government is like the Arbitrum DAO, the illusion that your vote matters and youll be represented. In the end theyll push what they want regardless of how their constituents feel about it Wouldn\\'t a CBDC remove the need for banks in many situations? We are lead by liars and crooks. dystopian horror Please dont offer to sell your crypto to fund her similarly corrupt rival either 🤣 Remember when Elizabeth Warren pretended to be a Native American for decades?  She’s a particularly weird fraud.\\n\\nWhether she gets re-elected or not, cryptocurrencies will be unstoppable, which is all that drives cryptocurrencies to grow. The weekend is over. and the cbdc is backed up by faith in the government and its printing press. Once upon a time some colonies came together to free themselves from the tyranny of royal rule; it appears it has slowly, over time, reformed itself at our expense... It\\'s not that they don\\'t want crypto, it\\'s that they want to control crypto for their selves. As a high level crypto/blockchain developer, I can confidently tell you that CBDCs are the most dangerous thing to society next to nuclear war.\\n\\nThe fortunate thing, most developers don’t want anything to do with them. It could still realistically happen. It allows the government to swap printing for pressing return, and it’s a SCARY tool to monitor society. Privacy disappears immediately.\\n\\nI’ve consulted for several NGOs, Top 10 Banks, two governments, and 3 of 5 FAANG companies on blockchain development. All have their sights on this pie, and WAY more than AI.\\n\\nPlease. Please pay attention to this as it develops. Vote against it. Campaign and donate against it. Do all you can. Saylor 2024 Banks failing, inflation hitting hard, US bonds suffering meltdowns.\\nBut wait, let\\'s forget all that and do some stupid shit just because we hate Crypto. Anything she is a fan of, I am not. Big government politicians doing big government policy you don’t say. Stop voting for these skells. Ban her. Not a surprise. She wants to centralize everything into the governments hands. Tell me you\\'re a government shill without saying you\\'re a shill You seppos have some of the dumbest politicians in the world, and I’m australian …. We might have the dumbest ever but you lot are really starting to take the cake … She\\'d shill you LUNA if it was released by the government... Because she is pro banks and crypto threatens them! Isn\\'t this obvious by now? The senator who runs oversight on the too-big-to-fail banks wants to give them even more power through CBDCs. The government does not want financial freedom for the people or any sort of decentralized monetary system.  If they cannot control at will every aspect of it then they will fight and take it to extreme measures.  \\n\\nFuck CBDCs and Fuck Warren.  The government has proven to be irresponsible at managing money, so giving them full control over CBDCs would be even worse.  They are definitely NOT safe when the government can mint as much as they want, when they want.  The value will crash in a matter of years if not months Liz Warren is the worst Ahh yes, exactly what I need in my life: currency that can be monitored and is also mutable. Hot take: I\\'m not against CBDC. They provide far more flexibility on those who need/want to keep using fiat while introducing people to this new internet money thing. I think that CBDCs will be an entry point for those who, after introduced to this new and exciting tech that is blockchain, migrate to decentralised options.\\n\\nAlso, I don\\'t really much mind it - with all the shitfest that most stables have been, I think this could be a good option for tradfi or for keeping your investments safe from volatility in between trading sessions. It\\'s not like you can \\\\*actually\\\\* trust stablecoins these days to do that (lost money with USTC, bad day to have dumped profits into it, it was just for a few days). To think I used to kinda like her. But she\\'s turned out to be such a fucking useful idiot for the banking establishment. A CBDC is authoritarian establishment cranked up to 11. Fucking gross, Liz. She’s bought and paid for. Simple as that. Beautiful I lost this post at 73.. Well I am shocked! Shocked, I say! Hopefully people see through her ideas. \\n\\nEdited for typos Decentralize the world So bitcoin is bad because it‘s backed by nothing. But their shitcoin is backed by the government. \\n\\nYea sure. I pick the government anytime over something they can’t control. /s At least it\\'s nice that her motivates are clear (remove crypto, add dystopian controllable money). Our enemy has revealed itself Another corrupt politician. Who would have guessed. Get what u vote for I suppose. Btitcoin to billion I bet she will be taking Crypto donations if enough people ask Don\\'t share anything after the question mark bro, it\\'s all for tracking. Share like this.\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/watcherguru/status/1642643472078237696 Well it looks like they\\'re not even hiding it anymore. They\\'re trying their best to control crypto and make sure we can never leave the rat race Well well well if it ain\\'t the cbdc cunt You\\'d be surprised at how many people support the idea of things like Digital ID, CBDC etc.   \\nThey literally just hate the private sector equivalents.   \\n\"You have no privacy anyways, better that the government has the info than Facebook\". Oh so crypto is only bad when the people have the power. Figures. this old globalist WEF/UN hag is pushing for anything her overlord puppet masters are ordering.\\n\\nPay for play politicians disgusting, corrupt scum. Gulag time is WAY overdue.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYou think any of these dumb morons who never had a real job know a thing about *\"the technology\"?* All they know is how to protect their power and how to f\\\\*ck us over, rob and exploit us, send our cash to their special interest groups on a daily basis. Does anyone know how much money she has raised from big banks? She’s likely been briefed by the CIA/Feds and told she has to criticize it or lose influence. It’s clear many in government now see bitcoin as the existential threat to their ability to do what they see is right. Money outside their control = people who they think are criminals transacting freely. yeah she is going to siphon everyone\\'s cash into her bank account using cbcunt dick she can fuck off She is an establishment shill.  She knows nothing about what she says, she just says it.  You will know when someone isn\\'t establishment as they will be relentlessly attacked. yes -she is not anti technology she is anti wild wild west crypto rugpull, scam, make devs insta rich. ![gif](giphy|CNna9G8BQvnoI) Oh yeah, anything to push their new CBDC agenda. We are well on our way to being forced to own nothing This feels a lot like gaslighting the more these people talk. Bitcoin is backed by trust. Which is far more than I can say about the gov and banks. No shit, she wants ultimate control of your money, which is exactly what a CBDC will accomplish. That interview is like a year old, she\\'s been pushing CBDCs since at least last year. It’s all part of the script, pass laws to outlaw crypto in America than launch new CBDC along with the new and improved/highly traceable Digital U.S. dollar.. once the threat of cryptos is gone they can move forward without saying the fiat dollar ever crashed… Of course she is but no one wants a government backed digital coin Grandma, rest. They want power so ofcourse they want CBDC Counterpoint: a U.S. CBDC would be the worlds only rock-solid USD Tethercoin, and it’s existence could greatly stabilize the crypto ecosystem by giving people a stablecoin intermediary run by the same institution that issues the FIAT that current stablecoins already claim to be backed by. She’s anti public use crypto, not anti blockchain technology.  She wants power just like everyone else it seems Oh yes the .000000000001%  Native American of Boston I\\'m telling you, Elizabeth Warren has no fundamental value 73 years old, she should not be deciding the fate of the young Damn she never stops Her biggest donors are big banks. \\n\\nI’m not surprised that she and other politicians are pushing this CBDC’s Agenda and influencing the market based on who are filling their pockets! So what? You think crypto is so weak that it can\\'t survive competition from CBDCs?\\n\\nAs long as they don\\'t ban crypto, then people have the freedom to choose. I think people who try to ban CBDCs are just tyrannical as the people they\\'re opposing.\\n\\n**Let us have freedom of choice.** I never cared for Pocahontas. Now I really don\\'t like her. Absolute worst senator of all time. I don’t care who y’all vote for next election but please don’t vote for her hypocritical authoritarian ass. Long live Crypto! She’s a whore The tyrany is blatant There should be a limit on age in the elections.\\n\\nThis will only stop the innovations. Can old people please just step away from crypto? You have fucked up the future for us enough already. Thanks. The two go hand in hand no? Elizabeth Warren be like:\\n\\nBitcoin and crypto are risky but our CBDC, which is also a digital asset, is completely fine.\\n\\nLol I was really expecting her to stop being wrong after a 73 year unbroken streak of being wrong. A shocking development. Seems to be a bot in here down voting everyone making a good point about cbdc. CBDC is bad ya dumb bot! I just have no love for this woman.  Her head is so far up her own uppity ass, it\\'s not even funny. Which of her constituents are supporting her constant bullshit? Damn them.  Do not reelect this career politician to any position in our government! Well yeah, establishment Democrats despise the idea of people having control over their lives and their money, without them being able to take it and spend it for you.\\n\\nCrypto is inherently aligned with liberal conservative political ideologies. Which makes it so interesting to see it clash with reddit and its biased, censored landscape  Then she can decide where you can spend your money and track every purchase we make.  Perfect for her “make America like China” campaign. There is no stopping the CBDC, all we can hope is that crypto is allowed to exist within regulation I understand social justice issues in America and how the Left “Champions” them but only the blind and ignorant dont see how the Democratic Party is using these issues to usher in complete and absolute Autonomy over your lives. Warren is as old school Globalist as it gets. Are you surprised that a sovereign country wants to control its own currency? Y’all crypto bros spewing random hate based on things like *checks notes* her age(?) are the reason we have a bad name. Crypto is not going to issue in some new era of financial freedom for the lower class. It’s got A LOT of problems and is rife with scams. You want it to succeed? Regulate it. Or it’s going away. \\n\\nYour most hated senator has been championing the middle and lower class and fighting the banks for her entire career. It’s her life’s work. But she has said some hard truths about something you stan, so I guess she is an evil bitch now. \\n\\nAt least get your facts straight before coming to a political conclusion. \\n\\nI await the downvotes. Pocahontes Yep Warren has no idea what shes doing and is trying to kill innovation in the US Old skunk better think about taking her dementia pills and changing her diaper.\\nWhat a 73 years old can understand about crypto… seriously She’s seriously dumb. Sick of these people in power are just bought and paid for What an evil, stupid bitch Yikes Of course! She wants the government to control everyone. And that\\'s not an exaggeration. CBDC\\'s would end freedom. Dinosaur strikes again Fake Native American is a fraud down to the DNA in her cells. Literally ![gif](giphy|6nWhy3ulBL7GSCvKw6)\\n\\nThis is a total surprise, totally did not expect her to support CBDC at all after doing recruiting for her crypto-demonising “army” /s She don’t know how crypto works These Republicans must be stopped at all costs. She is just a puppet at this point pushing the cbdc agenda Useful idiot She\\'s ridiculous.. Hand waving puppets Absolute clown just like every other politician!'"
