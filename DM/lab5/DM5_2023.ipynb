    "In this lab, we will focus on web scraping, which involves programmatically interacting with websites to parse and extract relevant data. This process can range from a simple extraction of specific elements, like headlines or prices, to more complex tasks, such as navigating through multiple pages or handling dynamically loaded content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping can be applied in numerous scenarios, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Data gathering: Amassing large datasets from multiple sources to serve as input for Machine Learning or data analysis.\n",
    "2.   Market research: Extracting product information, reviews, and pricing to identify trends or perform competitive analysis.\n",
    "3.   Opinion Mining in Social Media: Collecting user-generated content, like social media posts or reviews, to analyze public opinion on a particular topic or product.\n",
    "4.   News aggregation: Aggregating news articles or blog posts to create a customized news feed."

Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.”\n",

LDA assumes that each document is a mixture of topics, and each topic is a distribution over words. The primary goal of LDA is to learn the topic distributions for each document and the word distributions for each topic."

    "\n",
    "LDA performs best when working with clean data. Here we introduce two simple steps we can perform in text data cleaning / preprocessing. These two steps we introduce are not always necessary, but they help some algorithms perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming and lemmatization are natural language processing techniques used to reduce words to their base or root form. These techniques are commonly used in text preprocessing to reduce the dimensionality of the data, decrease noise, and improve the performance of text analysis algorithms. The main difference between the two is the approach they take to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Stemming algorithms work by cutting off the end or beginning of a \n",
    "    word, considering only a few common prefixes and suffixes. This can lead to crude results where the stemmed word might not always be a valid word in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lemmatization**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Lemmatization algorithms take a more structured approach, considering the morphological analysis of the words. They aim to return the base or dictionary form of a word, known as the lemma. Lemmatization generally provides better results as it takes into account the context and part of speech of the word.\n",
